- include momemtum flux calc from temp and wind in intro or research question and respective conclusion!

- link arrows in vertical cross section to paragraph just before propagation in intro

- Hindley figure - observational filter!!! analysis of momentum flux comparison??
%% change figure to southern hemisphere and include observational filter, then state ern 2018 observational filter better for shorter vertical wavelengths still observe GW belt (hindley discusses this in 2019 paper!!!!
%Stratospheric zonal and meridional GWMF are illustrated on top of a map of the southern hemisphere. GWMF is derived from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) measurements between 2002 and 2019. Illustrated is the average over the austral winter months June â€“ August. The figure is taken from Hindley et al. (2020))
